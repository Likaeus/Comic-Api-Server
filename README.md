# Comic-Api-Server

This is a server proxy made with express in order to use the comic vine public api without having troubles with the CORS policies.
It also contains the two endpoinds that will be use in the front-end app.

In order to run this server an .env file is needed with the next format:
API_KEY="your api key from comic vine"

*NOTE* It is important to run spm install once to install node.js dependencies
